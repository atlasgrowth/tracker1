Just call us. Glad it didn\u2019t come to that. When I came up with the money for them to order and fix the issue they came right over. They kept me informed during the whole process, went above and beyond to check for other issues. They have been to my house multiple times and are always very courteous and willing to explain, in detail, the issues you\u2019re having and how they are going to rectify them. Problem is most ppl don\u2019t listen, but I digress. They don\u2019t leave a mess as you can see from the picture, they went out of their way to maintain cleanliness and that\u2019s much appreciated and most of the time overlooked and under praised.

They kept me up to date on when they were on their way to my house and when my part came in, the cost, and with any questions I had. They had my air handler unit up and going in 30 minutes. I tried contacting 7 or so HVAC businesses in Paragould that day and only two answered my call. Mid-South was the only one that could help me, the other couldn't get a tech to me, but actually recommended me to call Mid-South. The others that I could leave messages with haven't even returned my call still. I'll use Mid-South again for sure!",

I called first thing the next morning. There was no answer and the voicemail was full. I sent a text asking if they were coming and immediately got a response saying that they broke the cable on the machine yesterday. No one contacted me to let me know.

He told me this handle in the picture is fine even though the handle was clearly rotting and about to break. He said if I wanted it fixed I would have to put in another order paying full cost again. He said I'm supposed to specify everything wrong before they come out. How am I supposed to know everything causing the flushing problem I'm not a professional they are.

They charged her 900 plus tax for not even a hour worth of work 450 for the hot water heater and the rest in labor they didn't clean up any water I did I borrowed the neighbors shop vac and removed the water they just rolled in a new hot water heater and left they opened the back door didn't say anything and just let her cat out.  On the way out they only thing he said was that i could clean up the house now which was obviously a mess from the gushing water. They also ripped her floor by moving her washer and dryer which was extremely soft from the hot gushing water they have no respect for personal property not worth your money choose anyone else it's the biggest rip off in Benton. If give them no stars if It would let me what a joke.",

He was knowledgeable, helpful and prompt.\nHis company is very thorough and easy to work with.  He went out of his way to find out about the gas company moving meters and saved me $1400.00 on my job.
